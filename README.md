# apple_leaf_disease

This project was developed as my undergraduate final year thesis, focused on predicting apple leaf diseases using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model achieves accuracy comparable to larger architectures like ResNet-18 and VGG-16 while drastically reducing model size, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. The implementation was done using Python and TensorFlow, and trained on the PlantVillage dataset.
